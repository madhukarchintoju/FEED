            The foreign trade policy in India is basically a set of guidelines
            for the import &amp; export of goods &amp; services. The policy is
            formulated by the DGFT (Directorate General of Foreign Trade), which
            is the governing body to promote &amp; facilitate the exports &amp;
            imports of the goods under the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The policy is notified for the period of 5 years and is updated on
            31st March every year and comes to effect on 1st April. Though the
            policy covers the aspect of imports &amp; exports, its primary aim
            is to facilitate trade by reducing the cost of transaction &amp;
            time &amp; by making the Indian exports competitive globally.
